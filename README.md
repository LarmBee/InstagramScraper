"# InstagramScraper" 
The scraper is written in Python and Selenium
Currently all the scraper gets you is :
1:The Name
2:Number of posts 
3.Number of Followers 
4.Number Following 
I would love to implement also:
1:Post links
2:Are the posts videos or images
3:The number of likes on each post
4:Number of comments on each post

Pleae keep the code well documented so as to enable even those learning Python and Selinium to understand whats happening
Have fun and Enjoy
