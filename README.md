"# InstagramScraper" 
The scraper is written in Python and Selenium
Currently all the scraper gets you is the Name,Number of posts , Followers and Following from Instagram
Would love to implement also:
1:Post links
2:Are the posts videos or images
3:The number of likes on each post
4:Number of comments on each post

Pleae keep the code well documented so a to enable even those learning Python and Selinium to understand whats happening
Have fun and Enjoy
